# Friend-Finder
Users of this app can take a compatibility quiz to get matched with other users.

This app uses Express.js for routes, and matching logic is handled in the backend. Bootstrap 4 is used for layout, and the logo is a custom SVG. The app was originally hosted on Heroku, but is now on Fly.
